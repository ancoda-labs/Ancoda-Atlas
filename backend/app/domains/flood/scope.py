"""What "this flood" means, in one place.

Three facts define the desk's scope: when the event started, which districts it
covers, and the box the corridor sits in. They were previously typed into four
files that disagreed — the incident window was 2026-08-25 in one source and
2026-08-20 in both its callers, so the same question asked two ways returned
different answers, and the district list existed in three different lengths.

This is deliberately configuration, not a live feed. No portal publishes "the
districts affected by the Rasuwa flood" as data. The district list is an
editorial judgement about scope, and deriving it from whichever districts
happen to have logged an incident in the last hour would make the map and the
contact list flicker as the register moves.
