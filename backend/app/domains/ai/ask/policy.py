"""What the sandbox will and will not answer.

Three intents are refused outright, and each refusal is a considered position
rather than a limitation:

  rescue_person — the box cannot search names. The registers are partial and
  separate, and absence from one is not a death. Sending someone to the rescue
  page is the honest answer; guessing is not.

  safety_advice — this desk does not tell anyone whether to stay or leave. That
  decision belongs to NDRRMA and the police, who can see things Atlas cannot.

  prediction — Atlas reads model output and satellite feeds. It is a monitoring
  aid, not a warning system, and a confident forecast from it would be read as
  one.

Classification is regex over the question rather than a model call, because the
refusal must not depend on a model being available, configured, or in a good
mood.
